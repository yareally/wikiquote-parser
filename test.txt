* All men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the "elect" have seen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it. I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so "slow," so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If [[Joseph Smith]] composed this book, the act was a miracle — keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he found under a stone in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.

* Oh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that "plagiarism" farce! As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, ''except'' plagiarism! '''The kernal, the soul — let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of ''all'' human utterances — is plagiarism.''' For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. '''When a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men — but we call it ''his'' speech, and really some exceedingly smail portion of it ''is'' his. But not enough to signify.''' It is merely a Waterloo. It is Wellington's battle, in some degree, and we call it his; but there are others that contributed. '''It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others.''' He added his little ''mite'' — that is all he did. '''These object lessons should ''teach'' us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest.''' But nothing can do that. <br> <!-- Then why don't we unwittingly reproduce the ''phrasing'' of a story, as well as the story itself? It can hardly happen — to the extent of fifty words except in the case of a child: its memory-tablet is not lumbered with impressions, and the actual language can have graving-room there, and preserve the language a year or two, but a grown person's memory-tablet is a palimpsest, with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a phrase. It must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply printed upon a man's mind, by a single reading, that it will stay long enough to turn up some time or other and be mistaken by him. for his own. No doubt we are constantly littering our literature with ''disconnected'' sentences borrowed from books at some unremembered time and now imagined to be our own, but that is about the most we can do. In 1866 I read Dr. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Holmes]]'s poems, in the Sandwich Islands. A year and a half later I stole his dictation, without knowing it, and used it to dedicate my "Innocents Abroad" with. Then years afterwards I was talking with Dr. Holmes about it. He was not an ignorant ass — no, not he: he was not a collection of decayed human turnips, like your "Plagiarism Court;" and so when I said, "I know now where I stole it, but whom did you steal it from," he said, "I don't remember; I only know I stole it from somebody, because I have never originated anything altogether myself, nor met anybody who had." <br> To think of those solemn donkeys breaking a little child's heart with their ignorant rubbish about plagiarism! I couldn't sleep for blaspheming about it last night. Why, their whole lives, their whole histories, all their learning, all their thoughts, all their opinions were one solid ruck of plagiarism, and they didn't know it and never suspected it. A gang of dull and hoary pirates piously setting themselves the task of disciplining and purifying a kitten that they think they've caught filching a chop! Oh, dam — <br> But you finish it, dear, I am running short of vocabulary today. -->

* "In God We Trust." Now then, after that legend had remained there forty years or so, unchallenged and doing no harm to anybody, the President suddenly "threw a fit" the other day, as the popular expression goes, and ordered that remark to be removed from our coinage. <br> Mr. Carnegie granted that the matter was not of consequence, that a coin had just exactly the same value without the legend as with it, and he said he had no fault to find with Mr. Roosevelt's action but only with his expressed reasons for the act. The President had ordered the suppression of that motto because a coin carried the name of God into improper places, and this was a profanation of the Holy Name. Carnegie said the name of God is used to being carried into improper places everywhere and all the time, and that he thought the President's reasoning rather weak and poor. <br> I thought the same, and said, "But that is just like the President. If you will notice, he is very much in the habit of furnishing a poor reason for his acts while there is an excellent reason staring him in the face, which he overlooks. '''There was a good reason for removing that motto; there was, indeed, an unassailably good reason — in the fact that the motto stated a lie. If this nation has ever trusted in God, that time has gone by; for nearly half a century almost its entire trust has been in the Republican party and the dollar–mainly the dollar.''' I recognize that I am only making an assertion and furnishing no proof; I am sorry, but this is a habit of mine; sorry also that I am not alone in it; everybody seems to have this disease. <br> Take an instance: the removal of the motto fetched out a clamor from the pulpit; little groups and small conventions of clergymen gathered themselves together all over the country, and one of these little groups, consisting of twenty-two ministers, put up a prodigious assertion unbacked by any quoted statistics and passed it unanimously in the form of a resolution: the assertion, to wit, that this is a Christian country. Why, Carnegie, so is hell. Those clergymen know that, inasmuch as "Strait is the way and narrow is the gate, and few — few — are they that enter in thereat" has had the natural effect of making hell the only really prominent Christian community in any of the worlds; but we don't brag of this and certainly it is not proper to brag and boast that America is a Christian country when we all know that certainly five-sixths of our population could not enter in at the narrow gate.

* I do not take any credit to my better-balanced head because I never went crazy on Presbyterianism. We go too slow for that. You never see us ranting and shouting and tearing up the ground, You never heard of a Presbyterian going crazy on religion. Notice us, and you will see how we do. We get up of a Sunday morning and put on the best harness we have got and trip cheerfully down town; we subside into solemnity and enter the church; we stand up and duck our heads and bear down on a hymn book propped on the pew in front when the minister prays; we stand up again while our hired choir are singing, and look in the hymn book and check off the verses to see that they don't shirk any of the stanzas; we sit silent and grave while the minister is preaching, and count the waterfalls and bonnets furtively, and catch flies; we grab our hats and bonnets when the benediction is begun; when it is finished, we shove, so to speak. No frenzy, no fanaticism --no skirmishing; everything perfectly serene. You never see any of us Presbyterians getting in a sweat about religion and trying to massacre the neighbors. Let us all be content with the tried and safe old regular religions, and take no chances on wildcat.

* There is a sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the stranger's admiration — and regret. The weather is always doing something there; always attending strictly to business; always getting up new designs and trying them on people to see how they will go. But it gets through more business in spring than in any other season. In the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of twenty-four hours.

* Probable nor'east to sou'west winds, varying to the soutard and westard and eastard and points between; high and low barometer, sweeping round from place to place; probable areas of rain, snow, hail, and drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes with thunder and lightning.

=== ''[[w:A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (1889) ===
*Why, it was like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood -- one: a settlement of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell. There were two "Reigns of Terror," if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the "horrors" of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror -- that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.

* The citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal, he is a traitor. That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him: it is his duty to agitate anyway, and it is the duty of others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does.

* My kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its institutions or its officeholders. The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death.

=== ''Concerning the Jews'' (Harper's Magazine, Sept. 1899) ===
* I have no race prejudices nor caste prejudices nor creed prejudices. All I care to know is that a man is a human being, and that is enough for me; he can't be any worse.

*I have no special regard for Satan; but, I can at least claim that I have no prejudice against him. It may even be that I lean a little his way, on account of his not having a fair show. All religions issue bibles against him, and say the most injurious things about him, but we never hear his side. We have none but the evidence for the prosecution, and yet we have rendered the verdict. To my mind, this is irregular. It is un-English, it is un-American; it is French.

* The Jew is not a disturber of the peace of any country. Even his enemies will concede that. He is not a loafer, he is not a sot, he is not noisy, he is not a brawler nor a rioter, he is not quarrelsome. In the statistics of crime his presence is conspicuously rare — in all countries. With murder and other crimes of violence he has but little to do: he is a stranger to the hangman. In the police court's daily long roll of "assaults" and "drunk and disorderlies" his name seldom appears ...

* A Jewish beggar is not impossible, perhaps; such a thing may exist, but there are few men that can say they have seen that spectacle.

* These facts are all on the credit side of the proposition that the Jew is a good and orderly citizen. Summed up, they certify that he is quiet, peaceable, industrious, unaddicted to high crimes and brutal dispositions; that his family life is commendable; that he is not a burden upon public charities; that he is not a beggar; that in benevolence he is above the reach of competition. These are the very quintessentials of good citizenship.

* If the statistics are right, the Jews constitute but one percent of the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the blaze of the Milky Way. Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of, but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His contributions to the world's list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvellous fight in the world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it. The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and the Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains. What is the secret of his immortality?

===''True Citizenship at the Children's Theater'' 1907 ===
* Citizenship? We have none! In place of it we teach patriotism which Samuel Johnson said a hundred and forty or a hundred and fifty years ago was the last refuge of the scoundrel -- and I believe that he was right. I remember when I was a boy and I heard repeated time and time again the phrase, 'My country, right or wrong, my country!' How absolutely absurd is such an idea. How absolutely absurd to teach this idea to the youth of the country.

===''Christian Science'' 1907 ===
*When I, a thoughtful and unblessed Presbyterian, examine the Koran, I know that beyond any question every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious matters. When a thoughtful and unblessed Mohammedan examines the Westminster Catechism, he knows that beyond any question I am spiritually insane. I cannot prove to him that he is insane, because you never can prove anything to a lunatic--for that is a part of his insanity and the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me that I am insane, for my mind has the same defect that afflicts his. All Democrats are insane, but not one of them knows it; none but the Republicans and Mugwumps know it. All the Republicans are insane, but only the Democrats and Mugwumps can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane.

* '''There has never been a just one, never an honorable one — on the part of the instigator of the war.''' I can see a million years ahead, and this rule will never change in so many as half a dozen instances. The loud little handful — as usual — will shout for the war. The pulpit will — warily and cautiously — object — at first; the great, big, dull bulk of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be a war, and will say, earnestly and indignantly, "It is unjust and dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it." Then the handful will shout louder. A few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war with speech and pen, and at first will have a hearing and be applauded; but it will not last long; those others will outshout them, and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity. Before long you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers — as earlier — but do not dare to say so. And now the whole nation — pulpit and all — will take up the war-cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths will cease to open. Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.

*A God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice, and invented hell — mouths mercy, and invented hell — mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people, and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites his poor abused slave to worship him!

* There is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a Dream, a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And '''You are but a Thought — a vagrant Thought, a useless Thought, a homeless Thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities.'''

=== Taming the Bicycle (1917) ===
[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/70 What is Man? and Other Essays]

* The bicycle had what is called the 'wabbles', and had them very badly. In order to keep my position, a good many things were required of me, and in every instance the thing required was against nature. Against nature, but not against the laws of nature.

* Try as you may, you don't get down as you would from a horse, you get down as you would from a house afire. You make a spectacle of yourself every time.

* The self-taught man seldom knows anything accurately, and he does not know a tenth as much as he could have known if he had worked under teachers;

* There are those who imagine that the unlucky accidents of life—life's "experiences"—are in some way useful to us. I wish I could find out how. I never know one of them to happen twice. They always change off and swap around and catch you on your inexperienced side.

* Before taking final leave of me, my instructor inquired concerning my physical strength, and I was able to inform him that I hadn't any.

* I started out alone to seek adventures. You don't really have to seek them—that is nothing but a phrase—they come to you.

* I have seen it stated that no expert is quick enough to run over a dog; that a dog is always able to skip out of his way. I think that that may be true; but I think that the reason he couldn't run over the dog was because he was trying to. I did not try to run over any dog. But I ran over every dog that came along.

* '''Get a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live.'''

=== Bible Teaching and Religious Practice (1923) ===

* We began to stir against slavery. Hearts grew soft, here, there, and yonder. There was no place in the land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity for the slave. No place in all the land but one—the pulpit. It yielded at last; it always does. It fought a strong and stubborn fight, and then did what it always does, joined the procession—at the tail end. Slavery fell. The slavery text remained; the practice changed, that was all.

* During many ages there were witches. The Bible said so. the Bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live. Therefore the Church, after eight hundred years, gathered up its halters, thumb-screws, and firebrands, and set about its holy work in earnest. She worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned, tortured, hanged, and burned whole hordes and armies of witches, and washed the Christian world clean with their foul blood. Then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches, and never had been. One does not know whether to laugh or to cry. Who discovered that there was no such thing as a witch—the priest, the parson? No, these never discover anything. … There are no witches. The witch text remains; only the practice has changed. Hell fire is gone, but the text remains. Infant damnation is gone, but the text remains. More than two hundred death penalties are gone from the law books, but the texts that authorized them remain.

* In religion and politics, people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue, but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing.

* France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country.

* God's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn.

* France has usually been governed by prostitutes.

* The radical invents the views. When he has worn them out the conservative adopts them.

* Familiarity breeds contempt — and children.

* Good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person.

* Nature knows no indecencies; man invents them.

* Death, the only immortal who treats us all alike, whose pity and whose peace and whose refuge are for all — the soiled and the pure, the rich and the poor, the loved and the unloved.

We are all missionaries (propagandists of our views). Each of us disapproves of the other missionaries; in fact detests them, as a rule. I am one of the herd myself.

=== ''Papers of the Adams Family'' (1939) ===
: In the posthumous ''[[w:Letters from the Earth|Letters from the Earth: Uncensored Writings]]'', ed. Bernard DeVoto, 1939. First published in 1962 when the author's daughter, Clara Clemens, withdrew her objection.[ http://books.google.com/books?id=RHoQ1hPuUt4C&pg=PR7]

* Against our traditions we are now entering upon an unjust and trivial war, a war against a helpless people, and for a base object — robbery. At first our citizens spoke out against this thing, by an impulse natural to their training. Today they have turned, and their voice is the other way. What caused the change? Merely a politician's trick — a high-sounding phrase, a blood-stirring phrase which turned their uncritical heads: ''Our Country, right or wrong!'' An empty phrase, a silly phrase. It was shouted by every newspaper, it was thundered from the pulpit, the Superintendent of Public Instruction placarded it in every schoolhouse in the land, the War Department inscribed it upon the flag. And every man who failed to shout it or who was silent, was proclaimed a traitor — none but those others were patriots. To be a patriot, one had to say, and keep on saying, "Our Country, right or wrong," and urge on the little war. Have you not perceived that that phrase is an insult to the nation? <br>For in a republic, who is "the Country"? Is it the Government which is for the moment in the saddle? Why, the Government is merely a servant — merely a temporary servant; it cannot be its prerogative to determine what is right and what is wrong, and decide who is a patriot and who isn't. Its function is to obey orders, not originate them. Who, then, is "the country?" Is it the newspaper? Is it the pulpit? Is it the school-superintendent? Why, these are mere parts of the country, not the whole of it; they have not command, they have only their little share in the command. They are but one in the thousand; it is in the thousand that command is lodged; they must determine what is right and what is wrong; they must decide who is a patriot and who isn’t.
** Part VI: "Two Fragments from a Suppressed Book Called 'Glances at History' or 'Outlines of History' ".

* In a monarchy, the king and his family are the country; in a republic it is the common voice of the people. Each of you, for himself, by himself and on his own responsibility, must speak. And it is a solemn and weighty responsibility, and not lightly to be flung aside at the bullying of pulpit, press, government, or the empty catch-phrases of politicians. Each must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, and which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man. To decide it against your convictions is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may. If you alone of all the nation shall decide one way, and that way be the right way according to your convictions of the right, you have done your duty by yourself and by your country — hold up your head! You have nothing to be ashamed of. <br>Only when a republic's life is in danger should a man uphold his government when it is in the wrong. There is no other time. <br> This Republic's life is not in peril. The nation has sold its honor for a phrase. It has swung itself loose from its safe anchorage and is drifting, its helm is in pirate hands.

===''Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1'' (2010)===
edited by Harriet Elinor Smith

*...when you recollect something which belonged in an earlier chapter, do not go back, but jam it in ''where you are''. Discursiveness does not hurt an autobiography in the least.
**advice to his brother Orion, p. 8.

*You cannot lay bare your private soul and look at it. You are too much ashamed of yourself. It is too disgusting. For that reason I confine myself to drawing the portraits of others.
**p. 16.

*...an Autobiography is the truest of all books; for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the truth, shirkings of the truth, partial revealments of the truth, with hardly an instance of plain straight truth, the remorseless truth ''is'' there, between the lines, where the author-cat is raking dust upon it which hides from the disinterested spectator neither it nor its smell...—the result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily diligences.
**pp. 21–22.

*His grammar is foolishly correct, offensively precise. It flaunts itself in the reader's face all along, and struts and smirks and shows off, and is in a dozen ways irritating and disagreeable. To be serious, I write good grammar myself, but not in that spirit, I am thankful to say. That is to say, my grammar is of a high order, though not at the top. Nobody's is. Perfect grammar—persistent, continuous, sustained—is the fourth dimension, so to speak: many have sought it, but none has found it.
**p. 120.

*We have been housekeeping a fortnight, now—long enough to have learned how to pronounce the servants' names, but not how to spell them. We shan't ever learn to spell them; they were invented in Hungary and Poland, and on paper they look like the alphabet out on a drunk.
**p. 121.

*....it is not wise to keep the fire going under a slander unless you can get some large advantage out of keeping it alive. Few slanders can stand the wear of silence.
**p. 161.

*For many years I believed that I remembered helping my grandfather drink his whisky toddy when I was six weeks old, but I do not tell about that any more, now; I am grown old, and my memory is not as active as it used to be. When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are decaying, now, and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the latter. It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all have to do it.
**p. 210.

*The late Bill Nye once said "I have been told that Wagner's music is better than it sounds."
**p. 288.

*''All'' creatures kill—there seems to be no exception; but of the whole list, man is the only one that kills for fun; he is the only one that kills in malice, the only one that kills for revenge.
**p. 312.

*I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.
**p. 365.

*We are always anxious to be distinguished for a talent which we do not possess than to be praised for the fifteen which we do possess.
**upon being told he had a good head for business, p. 378.

*Persons who think there is no such thing as luck—good or bad—are entitled to their opinion, although I think they ought to be shot for it.
**p. 380.

*Howells applauded, and was full of praises and endorsement, which was wise in him and judicious. If he had manifested a different spirit I would have thrown him out of the window. I like criticism, but it must be my way.
**p. 441.

== Unsourced/ Possible Fakes ==
:'''<small>Twain is one of those major iconic figures to whom many statements become attributed; unsourced attributions to him should usually be treated with some skepticism, and ''often'' a great deal of it.</small>'''

===Writing and speaking===
* Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing.
**This quote, in both this and a slightly different form, is also attributed to [[Robert Benchley]].

* Few sinners are saved after the first twenty minutes of a sermon.
** Commonly attributed, but not found in any collection of Twain's writings. The earliest known attribution is Caroline Thomas Harnsberger, ''Mark Twain at Your Fingertips'' (1948), which cites the ''Hannibal Courier-Post'', 6 March 1935—twenty-five years after his death. Later sources<!-- ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'' (1992) by Garry Wills; ''The Wit & Wisdom of Mark Twain'' (1987) by Alex Ayres  --> cite the 1 March or 6 March 1835 editions of the ''Hannibal Courier-Post'', which was nine months before his birth.<!-- authorship begins at conception!? -->

* I don't give a damn for a man that can only spell a word one way.
** Although attributed to Twain as early as 1875, the earliest appearances of this joke, in 1855, are not from Twain. This quote does not appear in his writing and there is no specific evidence that Twain ever said it. For more information, see [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/25/spelling/ Quotation Investigator].

* Only presidents, editors and people with tapeworms have the right to use the editorial "we".
** Attributed to Twain as "only editors and people with tapeworms should say 'we' in writing" on p.247, ''Business Education World'', Volume 24, 1944, Gregg Publ. Co., but predated by:
**...three orders of men, by right, speak of themselves as "we". These are editors, royal personages, and people with tapeworms.
** "Mr Prentice", p.138, ''The Louisville Medical News'', Volumes 15-16, 1883.

*If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed; if you do read the newspaper, you’re misinformed.
**Commonly attributed to Twain, but no evidence so far.

* Never let your schooling interfere with your education.
** Variants: Don't let your son's/boy's schooling interfere too much with his education.  I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
** Not directly traceable to Twain; first attributed to him in early 1900s in latter form, as in ''Outing: sport, adventure, travel, fiction'', Volume 50, 1907, ed. Caspar Whitney, Albert Britt.

* I can teach anybody how to get what they want out of life. The problem is I can't find anybody who can tell me what they want.

=== Government and politics===

* Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.
** Abridged modern version of "Remember this, take it to heart, live by it, die for it if necessary: that our patriotism is medieval, outworn, obsolete; that the modern patriotism, the true patriotism, the only rational patriotism, is loyalty to the Nation All the time, loyalty to the Government when it deserves it" - spoken by Tsar Nicholas II in Twain's ''The Czar's Soliloquy'', 1905.

* If voting made any difference they wouldn't let us do it.
** No known attribution to Twain. This has also been attributed to [[Emma Goldman]]. “If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.”

* All you have to fear is your mother's cooking.
** No known attribution to Twain.

* Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on, or by imbeciles who really mean it.

=== History ===
* The past does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.
** Also quoted as "History does not repeat itself, It rhymes" and "History may not repeat itself, but it rhymes a lot."
** According to this [http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2005_02_13-2005_02_19.shtml#1108756279 notes on sourcing], Twain scholars agree that it sounds like something he would say, but they have been unable to find the actual quote in his writing.
*** Twain did write: "It is not worth while to try to keep history from repeating itself, for man's character will always make the preventing of the repetitions impossible." (''Mark Twain in Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events'' (1940), ed. Bernard DeVoto.).

=== Humor ===

* To my embarrassment, I was born in bed with a lady.
** Not by Twain but by [[Wilson Mizner]].

=== Religion ===
*It ain't those parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand.
** Not attributed to Twain until the 1970s, as in p.214, ''Christ the liberator''. 1971, John R. W. Stott, Inter Varsity Press.

=== Truth ===
* A lie can make it half way around the world before the truth has time to put its boots on.
** Attributed to Twain as "a lie will fly around the whole world while the truth is getting its boots on", ''Standard player monthly'', 1918, Volumes 3-4, Standard Pneumatic Action Co. An uncredited variant, "A lie will cover leagues while truth is putting on its boots", appears in ''The Judge'', Volume 67, 1914, Judge Publishing Company. The oldest known attribution (1831) is to [[Fisher Ames#boots|Fisher Ames]]: “falsehood proceeds from Maine to Georgia, while truth is pulling on his boots.”  [[Charles Spurgeon#boots|Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] said similar, adding "if you want a lie to go round the world, it will fly: it is as light as a feather, and a breath will carry it", in 1855.
** This has also been attributed to [[Winston Churchill]].

*'I once sent a telegram to 12 of my friends saying ALL IS DISCOVERED - FLEE AT ONCE. They all left town immediately.
** (This has also been attributed to [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with the caveat that only one of his friends disappeared.).

* Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
** ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=B0FTDIj0TM0C&pg=PA27&vq=%22Often,+the+less+there+is+to+justify+a+traditional+custom,+the+harder+it+is+to+get+rid+of+it.+%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=ACfU3U36xrtoBVuSvKcu1t941DOmwnrMkA The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Chap. V ]'' (1876).

Also attributed to contemporaries [[Edgar Wilson Nye|Bill Nye]] and [[Eli Perkins]] ([http://www.miningswindles.com/html/a_hole_in_the_ground_.html A Hole in the Ground]).

* Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; truth is not.
** (This appears to be from [[Following the Equator]].).

* It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.
** Frequently attributed to Twain, and often to Will Rogers, Satchel Paige, Artemus Ward, as well as others. ([http://wellnowbob.blogspot.com/2008/07/it-aint-what-you-dont-know.html]).

=== Weather ===
* If you don't like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.
** According to the ''Yale Book of Quotations'',  ed. Fred R. Shapiro (2006), Yale University Press, attributed to Twain in ''Try and Stop Me'' (1944), Bennett Cerf.

=== Statistics ===

**Both of these quotes appeared in the movie ''[[Man of the Year]]''.

*This is petrified truth.

**The book is a memoir and the quote is MacLaren recalling something Twain supposedly said to her when she was a little girl. There's no reason to doubt that this is an honest memoir, that MacLaren met Twain, and that he said something encouraging to her. It seems a stretch though to trust MacLaren's memory of something said to her decades earlier when she was just a girl enough to take her quotation marks literally. This quotation's status as an actual verbatim quote from Mark Twain seems dubious.

** Attributed to [[w:Markus Herz|Markus Herz]] by [[w:Ernst, Baron von Feuchtersleben|Ernst von Feuchtersleben]], ''Zur Diätetik der Seele'' (1841), [http://books.google.com/books?id=FLc6AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA95&dq=%22Lieber+Freund+Sie+werden+noch+einmal+an+einem+Druckfehler+sterben%22 p. 95]. First attributed to Twain in 1980s, as in ''The 637 best things anybody ever said'', (1982), Robert Byrne, Atheneum. See [[Talk:Mark_Twain#You_may_die_of_a_misprint|talk page]] for more info.

* Wagner's music is better than it sounds.
** Actually by [[Edgar Wilson Nye|Bill Nye]], possibly confused due to Twain quoting Nye in ''More tramps abroad'', 1897.

* Warm summer sun, shine kindly here;<br>Warm southern wind, blow softly here;<br>Green sod above, lie light, lie light — <br>Good-night, dear heart, good-night, good-night.
** Epitaph for his daughter, Olivia Susan Clemens (1896), this is actually a slight adaptation of the poem "Annette" by [[w:Robert Richardson|Robert Richardson]]; more details are available at [http://www.twainquotes.com/headstone.html "The Poem on Susy Clemens' Headstone"]

* The minority is always in the right. The majority is always in the wrong.
** Attributed to Twain, but never sourced. Suspiciously close to "A minority may be right, and the majority is always in the wrong." — Henrik Ibsen "Enemy of the People," as well as a famous quote from Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]

* There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.
** Often attributed to Twain, but he said it was attributed to [[Benjamin Disraeli#Misattributed|Benjamin Disraeli]] and this itself is probably a misattribution: see [[w:Lies, damned lies, and statistics|Lies, damned lies, and statistics]] and [[Leonard H. Courtney#To My Fellow-Disciples at Saratoga Springs (1895)|Leonard H. Courtney]]. Twain did, however, popularize this saying in the United States. His attribution is in the following passage from Twain's ''Autobiography'' (1924), Vol. I, p. 246 (apparently written in Florence in 1904) [http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/lies.htm]:
*** Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics".

* The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.
** Often attributed to Twain, but of unknown origin.[http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/scrapbook/04_trouble/] [http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=009Ckt] [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/19/MNGOBEA9JI1.DTL] [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/11/30/coldest-winter/ This entry from Quote Investigator] discusses some possible early sources.
** Twain did write, in ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3177/3177.txt Roughing It]'':
***The climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable. The thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round. It hardly changes at all. You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and Winter, and never use a mosquito bar. Nobody ever wears Summer clothing. You wear black broadcloth--if you have it--in August and January, just the same. It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one month than the other. You do not use overcoats and you do not use fans. It is as pleasant a climate as could well be contrived, take it all around, and is doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world. The wind blows there a good deal in the summer months, but then you can go over to Oakland, if you choose--three or four miles away--it does not blow there.

* Golf is a good walk spoiled.
** "Twain probably never uttered [these] words," according to R. Kent Rasmussen, editor of ''The Quotable Mark Twain'' (1998).

* I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.
** Often misattributed to Twain, this is actually by [[Blaise Pascal]], "Lettres provinciales", letter 16, 1657:
*** ''Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.''
*** Translation: I have only made this [letter] longer, because I have not had the opportunity to make it shorter.

* Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over.
** It seems likely that the attribution to Twain is apocryphal. It is not listed as authentic on [http://twainquotes.com/ Twainquotes], and is not listed at all in either R. Ken Ramussen's ''The Quotable Mark Twain'' (1998) or David W. Barber's ''Quotable Twain'' (2002).

* A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain.
** According to R. Ken Rasmussen in ''The Quotable Mark Twain" (1998) this is most probably not Twain's.

* Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.
** [http://www.bartleby.com/73/1982.html Notes on sourcing]
** Twain did say: 
*** "There is a sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the stranger's admiration — and regret. The weather is always doing something there ... In the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four and twenty hours. ...<br>Yes, one of the brightest gems in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it." (Speech at the dinner of New England Society in New York City, December 22, 1876)).

* Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
** This quote has been attributed to Mark Twain, but the attribution cannot be verified. The quote should not be regarded as authentic. — [http://www.twainquotes.com/Discovery.html Twainquotes]

* Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India.
** Max Müller, ''India: What Can India Teach Us?'' (1883), [http://books.google.com/books?id=pIVDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&dq=%22most+valuable+and+most+instructive+materials+in+the+history+of+man+are+treasured+up+in+India%22 p. 15]

* Censorship is telling a man he can't have a steak just because a baby can't chew it.
** Often attributed to Twain online, but unsourced. Alternate source: "The whole principle [of censorship] is wrong. It's like demanding that grown men live on skim milk because the baby can't have steak." — Robert Heinlein "The Man Who Sold the Moon" p.188. <!--Feel free to move this back up if you can source it.-->

* It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt.
** Cited as an example of "What Mark Twain ''Didn't'' Say" in ''Mark Twain'' by Geoffrey C. Ward, et. al.

* For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all. Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.

* The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small, manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.
**Commonly attributed to Twain in computer contexts and post-2000 inspirational books — the first sentence has also been attributed to Agatha Christie and Sally Berger.

== Quotes about Twain ==

* What if Mark Twain, that great chronicler of American culture, was alive today? Would he approve of today's online world? Well, maybe not. He certainly wouldn't be allowed on Facebook, especially if he refused — as he sometimes did — to go by anything other than his pen name: Mark Twain. <br> After all, savvy readers will remember that "Mark Twain" is an invention — a piece of riverboat slang. Twain's real name was the somewhat-less-pithy Samuel Langhorn Clemens. (True story: Before he was Twain, Clemens was often credited as "Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass.") And there's nothing that riles up Facebook more than a person – any person! – who refuses to use their real name. <br> Consider the peculiar case of another writer, [[Salman Rushdie]]. Rushdie recently had his account deactivated. After he sent Facebook HQ a copy of his passport, the social network reactivated the page, but forced him to use his birth name, Ahmed Rushdie. Rushdie eventually obtained a reversal, as well as an apology from the folks at the social network, but Facebook brass has stressed the importance of something called "real name culture," an idea also embraced by Google+ and several other social networks. <br> "Facebook has always been based on a real-name culture," Elliot Schrage, vice president of public policy at Facebook, told the New York Times. "We fundamentally believe this leads to greater accountability and a safer and more trusted environment for people who use the service." Maybe so. But it sure would have made Samuel Langhorn Clemens pretty cranky.
